703	You have 2 different styles for 1 1/2 barrel. Are they both the same?	I would never buy this product again. It sparked & burned my hand. Maybe mine was defective, but I decided to pay more and get something more reliable.	['Helen of Troy 1514 Brush Iron, White, 1 1/2 Inches Barrel']
705	Why isn't this product made with stronger bristles that don't easily break?	I wish I knew! I've had a couple break but it was when I dropped the brush accidentally. But that was even on carpet.

1463	is this really made by bulgary or is it a copy?	It was the REAL thing when I purchased it. Wonderful fragrance.	[]
3140	The Red Door listed says EDT and the box is for the Parfum. I need the EDP. Which is it? Is it authentic, not a knockoff?	"I actually ordered the Parfum (the one that said ""Parfum"" in the description), and that is what I got, no matter what the picture was. I have to say, I really didn't pay that much attention to what the box said in the picture, only the description wording. So, if it says Eau de Toilette, I would tend to believe it. The Parfum is the very same as what I pay a lot more for at Macy's or Kohl's. The smell is exactly the same and it has the same longevity of smell when wearing it."	['Introduced in 1989. Fragrance notes are red roses and orchids blend with other exotic flowers honey and spice, very sensual. Recommended use for romantic wear.']
3141	Dear handytc, Is this newer version with square top or older version with rounded top? Thx	I Don't recall my wife said it was fake and tossed it.	['Introduced in 1989.

3143	Does anyone know if this fragrance is similar to perfume Revlon Intimate, made many years ago?	I have never smelled Intimate, but Red Door smells like really sexy flowers. It not heavy, but a light smell of jasmine. Everyone has told me how it reminds them of walking in a small flower garden with butterflies.	['Introduced in 1989. Fragrance notes are red roses and orchids blend with other exotic flowers honey and spice, very sensual. Recommended use for romantic wear.']
3144	Is this the original formula or the new version	The original formula but a new bottle. The bottle is a red door. The smell is awesome. I've been buying this for 10 years and I refuse to let myself run out	['Introduced in 1989. Fragrance notes are red roses and orchids blend with other exotic flowers honey and spice, very sensual. Recommended use for romantic wear.']
3145	I see 2 different looking 3.3 Red Door spray bottles and they are both called the very same thing. What is the difference?	There is a new line in a pink bottle called Red Door Revealed. The original bottle of Red Door is in the red colored package. Also, there is a perfume and a cologne spray. The perfume is highly concentrated verses the cologne. I hope this helps. :)	['Introduced in 1989. Fragrance notes are red roses and orchids blend with other exotic flowers honey and spice, very sensual. Recommended use for romantic wear.']

3148	what is the difference between the perfume and the toilette spray	Toilette Spray or water is less concentrated than perfume. It regularly contains 1-7% concentration of perfume if I remember correctly. In a way, it's like body spray.While Eau de Parfume has around 8-16% perfume and lasts a lot longer. Perfume is just the concentrate, which in my opinion is the best.	['Introduced in 1989. Fragrance notes are red roses and orchids blend with other exotic flowers honey and spice, very sensual. Recommended use for romantic wear.']
3149	I am from Ecuador and I see that the price is $31.47. Is this correct?	Yes	['Introduced in 1989. Fragrance notes are red roses and orchids blend with other exotic flowers honey and spice, very sensual. Recommended use for romantic wear.']
3203	Did this kits come with bottles of gel or powder or wax remover?	it comes with about 5 different bottles of stuff: pre-wax cleanser, post wax cooling gel, post wax moisturizer, slow grow oil, concealor. it does not come with powder or wax remover. However, I find that plain old baby oil works great as a wax remover and baby powder is a great friction barrier - both are cheap and readily available at any store.

3227	Is this okay for after shaving	It CAN be. This depends on a) how temperamental your skin is and b) where (what area of your body) you are going to use it on. You won't have much use of it, let's say, on your legs or underarms. On the face, you should first test it - there is nothing in here that should provoke an irritation, BUT, some people's skin is sensitive after shaving. So try it on your cheek or chin first, and try it before, and after, shaving. One might work better for you than the other. Also, I am not sure what you expect from this product, but keep in mind that it is for deep-cleansing and shrinking pores. I find that it also firms and tightens my face a bit, and smoothies out any bumps on my upper arms and chest.

4646	Hi! If you have a tendency to breakout is this okay?Is it better to use the 10% lotion rather than12&#x2105;souffle?I have lines&amp;acne:((Advice appreciated.	Start with the 10% and after you go through the product than move up to 12%. I have combo/oily skin and also sensitive to break out. This product works good for me. If you have a breakout that you messed with, this will sting a tad when it enters the poped zit. It is a acid- so if you sweat it off and it runs into your eyes it may also burn- so I apply before bedtime and it does not discolor my pillow cases.

6022	Why did they stop making this product?	I think I just figured it out today....Jean Nate used to be manufactured by Charles of the Ritz. My bottle from years ago has their name on the back. Now it is manufactured by Revlon. Maybe they bought out the Jean Nate name from Charles of the Ritz, but had to change the formula. Now it smells like a cheap cologne or bug repellent.	"[""A classic since 1935, Jean Nate's silkening body powder will leave you feel silky smooth and soft throughout the day.""]"
6023	How do I get the powder out of the paper package? Do I just rip it open and pour into the yellow plastic container?	Just cut around the top of the paper.	"[""A classic since 1935, Jean Nate's silkening body powder will leave you feel silky smooth and soft throughout the day.""]"
6024	Does the powder contain talc?	I have some older containers and some say Jean Nate Talc and others say powder, so really think they all contain Talc.	"[""A classic since 1935, Jean Nate's silkening body powder will leave you feel silky smooth and soft throughout the day.""]"

6027	I bought the 30 oz in 2013 for $70.00 now it is $183.00 Why? And why did Revlon stop making this product when so many women love it?	It's all a suppy vs. demand!

6387	how long are they?	They are all 8.5 inches long. However, there are various width sizes in the package. Here's the breakdown from largest to smallest.

6391	Conflicting reviews- Are they plastic or rubber? Can you comfortably sleep in them?	They are like firm foam which is easy and comfortable to sleep in.

8910	States it is a rotating brush - sounds stupid but does the brush itself rotate?	"If by ""rotating"" you mean does it turn independently on its own, the answer is no. however, If you push the button to untangle a section of hair that has gotten tangled in the teeth of the brush and continue to hold it, the brush will be free to rotate as you pull your hair away from your scalp to disentangle it.

"Begin using the blow drying curler when your hair is about 80% dry. Start with small sections at a time and roll from the end of hair to the scalp. Hold in place for a couple of seconds. Unroll and leave alone and let hair cool. Give yourself time to experiment. I have short hair and use a 3/4"" curler.

27199	"I noticed you changed the ingredient list very recently (why?). The bottle no longer states ""chemical-free"", Is the new formulation free of chemicals?"	"Hi Pen, I am a user and you right. Currently the front image is not having the label statement ""Chemical-Free . pH Balanced""; the same in the label below. Also there is other change in the lowest label instead of saying ""with Coconut Oil"" now says ""with KuKui Oil"". That indicates that they changed the original formulation. I have still a bottle saying the original descriptions. Chemical-Free is the main reason for me to buy this product. While they keep guaranteed that this product is pH-balanced and continue having No SLS and Organic Ingredients also no animal or human cruelty tests I will continue buying it otherwise they will lose a great customer. Regards..."	['Natural Shampoo with Kukui Nut Oil. Natural Lavender Scent.']
27200	Does this shampoo contain alcohol	Hi J., As per the bottle I have in my hands now there is nothing indicating that this shampoo contains alcohol. And I used it very often and I sensed no alcohol. The Ingredients are: Aqueous solution of Purified Water, Saponified *Coconut & *Olive Oils, Kukui Nut Oil, *Olive Leaf Extract, *Ginger Extract, *Honey, *Comfrey Root Extract, Lavender Oil, Vitamin B3, *Burdock Root Extract, *Grape Seed Extract, *Rosemary Extract, & d-Biotin; Coco-glucoside (from coconut oil), Vegetable Glycerin, Xanthan Gum. * (Certified Organic). I hope this information helps you. Regards...	['Natural Shampoo with Kukui Nut Oil. Natural Lavender Scent.']
27201	How long does this last? Does it have a expiration date?	That is a good question. So far my supply has lasted six months. But a competitors' natural shampoo purchased to trial has started to turn rancid. Hence my comment of good question as I just noticed that the other day when I thought I really ought to use that other brand shampoo up and noticed the objectionable smell while shampooing. So you definitely have 6 months. I still have 3 bottles form the same batch unopened so probably can extend that to 8-9 months testing before supply exhausts.	['Natural Shampoo with Kukui Nut Oil.

27939	is this 100% natural or organic zinc oxide? Is it nano-particle or non nano particle?	"Zinc Oxide is man made, so I don't know that it could ever be called ""organic"" or ""natural"". But, is it safe? 500 years of history says yes, just do not breath in the dust. When I ordered it, I remember that the particle size listed here was too big to penetrate pores, but it wasn't labeled ""non-nano"". To find one that is certainly non-nano, I'd go to soapgoods.com and type zinc oxide into their search."	[]
27940	Is this a non-nano zinc oxide?	"200-1000 nm. I use it for lip balm and add a tint of color so you don't see the ""white"". In sunscreen I don't mind the white"	[]
27941	"I live in Belgium and I tried to place an order, it says: ""We do not deliver the following products in the given country"". Why is this?"	Hello Suzanna, This could be because we so not ship to international countries through Amazon. We do ship internationally through our website makingcosmetics.com You can create an account with an email and password, you would then be able to shop for ingredients and see the shipping prices.

27943	What's the wash-off-ability of this powder, if added straight 2 skin? Wash off thorougly w/soap/cleanser, w/no residue? Pls help thx.	I wouldn't advise to add the powder straight to skin, since breathing in the particles is not healthful. It may leave some white residue, but i use a loofah face sponge with cleanser which does a good job at removing it.	[]
27944	What is the mean particle size of this product? Is it less than 100 nm?	"Hello there. To answer your question, no the mean particle size is NOT less than 100 nm. I searched for a few days to find a product that had a particle size of LARGER than 100nm. If you scroll down, under ""product description"" it states: ""Produced from naturally occurring zinc ore, super purity (free from other metals). Cosmetic grade particle size 200-1000 nanometer (nm) or 0. 2-1 micrometer)."""	[]

28404	What are all the ingredients?	My jar says: Coconut oil, Amber colloidal silver, gelling agent, and ph balancer. It does not list what the gell and balancer are specifically, but my skin is sensitive, and it does not irritate, but soothes and heals. I use it on my face for adult acne and some brown spots, which are bettered with even occasional use of this cream. The amber silver strength is supposed to be a better quality too. I really like using it.	['Optimised Energetics are committed to offering the finest quality Colloidal Silver products with the greatest choice and value anywhere.

28405	Hi, what does the 80% stand for? What is the silver content (I guess it would be in ppm)?	When silver has a ppm designation it is referring to ionic silver which contains nano particles of silver. True 80% plus colloidal silver has larger silver particles that are made from 20ppm ionic silver using a reducing agent and we call this Amber Silver. We have found that Amber silver is more successful when used in creams and gels.

33219	do you have to use glue to put it on the wanted object?	If you are putting them on your nails you can just put them directly onto slightly wet nail polish or put a drop of clear polish on the nail and then put a stone.

35879	I'm almost 25 years old and I'd like a GOOD cream to protect my skin against smog, stress, sun damage, and prevent wrinkles! Can I use it for my age??	I love this stuff. All natural, good for any sge. It's a good buy because it's s generous size and I like it more than many expensive creams I have tried	[]
35880	i did not see expiration date how long can i keep use this product after first use ??	I believe it will be fine for a long time, as it is sealed in a way that does not allow any air to enter, which would be the cause of spoilage. If you use it every day, it should last 8 weeks.	[]
35881	How does it smell? I've read the smell is overwhelming.	It smells really strongly of coffee. I was using it in the evening, and honestly, it kept me awake. I believe you can request it be unscented, and I would highly recommend doing that. I found the product to be unusable because of the smell.	[]
35882	should i keep this in refrigerator after the first use ?	I don't think there is a need to do that. However,my bathroom is very cold this winter, so its always chilled. Couldn't hurt tho. And cold does reduce inflammation, so maybe a good idea.	[]
35883	Can this be used under makeup (i.e., in the morning, before work) such as concealer? Does this moisturize, or do you need one?	I use it under makeup and I always use a moisturizer ( cerave pm ).	[]
35884	Is it gluten free, corn free, or soy free?	I think that you should ask producer not me I'm only buying this I dont think that I saw any of this ingredients there but I'm not sure	[]
36367	How many stencils does the set include	12 stencils but their very thick well made stencils and can be used over and over and over	[]
36368	are the stencils reusable?	We reused them. You can't reuse them A LOT but if you are careful you can get 2-3 times out of them	[]
36369	What is size of glitter tubs?	about the size of an eyeshadow	[]
36370	How many tattoo can you get out of 12 pack set? I need to know how many packs to buy. I am using it for a school event	For my daughter's party we had 15 kids and they all got at least 2 tattoos each. I still have some adhesive and glitter left for next year. You can also reuse the stencil 2-4 more times, if you are careful with it. If want you can buy more stencils for more of a variety, it only comes with 20 big and small. Also the smaller the stencil the more use you can get out of the adhesive and glitter. I hope this helps. :)	[]
36371	What is the best way to remove the tattoo?	Alcohol wipes or cotton pads soaked in baby oil helps to remove temp tattoos.	[]
36372	is this make-up grade glitter? can it be used with face painting? what are the ingredients????	I bought 4 sets of this product for a work picnic. The kids LOVED it! I would caution you when thinking about using the stencils on the face though. The tattoos stay for a few days, which also means the adhesive/glue is pretty strong. My daughter took baths, went swimming, etc and hers looked great for 3 days straight! The glitter is a bit larger than make-up grade glitter.	[]
36373	what is the size of the glue?	The little bottle isn't labeled with a size or anything, but I would say it is around 0.2 ounces?? There is still plenty of glue left after doing ~80 tattoos.	[]
36374	So just to clarify before I order. If I order 2 of these sets, I get everything pictured in the picture ? Or is there a 6 piece set and a 12 ?	Thank you for your inquiry. There are 3 different set variations to this item. INFORMATION ABOUT SETS: 6pc set includes 1 small cosmetic brush, 1 large cosmetic brush, 1 tube of glue, 15 stencils and the following glitter colors: Silver, Purple, Royal Blue, Pink, Green, and Gold.

36689	does Amazon sell this? or is this a profession product	Other salons, E-bay, even Sears sell this product. I stick w/Amazon - I shop buy price - so whoever has the lowest price go with it. This is great concealer... the 5th I've tried and the only one I continue to buy, I'm on my 15th.. it gives me 2 to 3 weeks longer on my tint process add that up for a year.. saving alot of money!. and I buy this in bulk when the price is low.

36690	can i use it to dye all my hair even if my hair is not gray i have a black hair and dose it come off esey	In my experience, it's really only good for covering your roots in between color treatments. It does wash out, but it's a bit stubborn, so you just need to shampoo heavily.	['STYLE EDIT by Style Edit CONCEAL YOUR GRAYS-MEDIUM/LIGHT BROWN 2 OZ']

36694	Can this be used to color eyebrows?	I personally would not try. The spray is wide and you'd get it all over your face and possibly in your eyes. I try to cover my cheek and ear with a wash cloth when spraying the area framing my face. I still end up with some on my face. I try to do it before putting on makeup since I end up wiping it off my face around the hair line.	['STYLE EDIT by Style Edit CONCEAL YOUR GRAYS-MEDIUM/LIGHT BROWN 2 OZ']
36695	Can I use it on my temples? Or is this product more for the top of the head? If I spray it on my temples, won't the color show up on my skin too?	I've found that using a plastic sun visor keeps this spray away from my skin/eyes. I've only used this product on my bangs, but you could still use the visor to protect your skin on the side of your face by holding it over that temple area.

I love it but it took awhile to figure out the best way to spray without it getting on my face! I haven't had a problem with rings of color a t hairline, but some skin types might react differently.

36697	I'm thinking about purchasing this item but worry about that I'll spray too much on my part. Is there a comb that comes with it to pull the hair away from the scalp? What is the best technique to use with this product?	you can't comb through it once its sprayed its on..kinda of like a heavy sticky hair spray. you wont spray too much, just a light dusting spray, you'll see once you get it.

36698	Once you want to dye your hair formaly, do you have to wash it out completely?	Hi Aprisas, I just washed my hair normally to remove the product and then applied my hair dye as usual. It worked fine. I'm not sure what would happen if you didn't wash the product out of your hair first. I would worry that he coating on your hair would interfere with the hair dye sticking to your hair. Anyway, good luck!	['STYLE EDIT by Style Edit CONCEAL YOUR GRAYS-MEDIUM/LIGHT BROWN 2 OZ']

38363	How to use it for hair?	A little goes a very long way. I use a fraction of a drop for my older, color-treated, and short hair during and after the blow dry. If I go a day without washing, I add another fraction of a drop and refresh with a light blow dry. Humidity has always caused my hair to frizz miserably (not helped, I suppose, by the color treating). Now, even when I go sailing on a high humidity day, my hair is only minimally affected.

38502	I bought 2 of them. The 2nd one won't pump, is there any thing to correct it?	The bottles have to be full in order to pump. It uses suction since it's not like a traditional pump where the tube extends to the bottom of the container. I actually just filled mine today and at first I had it about 3/4ths of the way full and it wouldn't pump, but when I filled it up more it worked perfectly.	[]
38503	Would this work well with oils? I'm looking for something to put avocado oil in (It's for my hair, so I'm looking to pump small amounts).	I've used this pump for body oil (almond and grape seed). It only dispenses very small amounts at a time.	[]

It might; I've tried a regular soap dispenser for toothpaste and it works, but you have to bang it on the counter a few times every once in a while because the toothpaste is so thick it doesn't settle automatically. This might work better because it sucks the little disk up as it dispenses. I gave up on the soap dispenser because it cracked after a while.

38813	do you need the serum?	I use aloe gel as the conducter. It works fine, just have to cleanse well after. Aloe was a suggestion from another source.	[]
40169	What's it made of? Can I mix it with stearic acid acid?	The ingredients to emulsifying wax are Cetearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 60, PEG-150 Stearate, and Steareth-20. Emulsifying wax allows for water to be mixed with oil without separating since emulsifying wax is both an oil and a detergent (allowing for water and oil molecules to bind to it). Stearic acid is used to make cream emulsions consisting of oils and waters thicker, to the point of being hard. You can mix stearic acid and emulsifying wax by melting them together and then adding them to your emulsion.	[]
40170	How can we get an ingredients list for this product?	I'm sorry, there is no listing anywhere on the bag of the product ingredients.	[]

40172	Stuff supposed to be nontoxic but Skin Deep says contamination concerns, ETHYLENE OXIDE, 1,4-DIOXANE, how can I be insured against presence of these?	"I don't make the product so I can't give you an assurance that it hasn't been contaminated. However, those chemicals are not listed as ingredients. Another website lists these as the ingredients: (Derived From) Cetostearyl alcohol, and Ethoxylated Sorbitan Ester. It also lists ""Ethylene Oxide- Absent"". This was the website that I was looking at: https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/emulsifying-wax/profile"	[]

40176	Can I use parrifin wax instead of emulsifying wax	Paraffin hardens....emulsifying wax blends ingredients.	[]
40177	Can you use this for homemade hair leave in creams?	Absolutely!!! That's the reason I bought this wax and it works greeeeat!!!	[]
40178	How to clean the measuring cups or blender that were used to mix this and oil so that they are safe to make food next time?	I used glass bowls/cups with the emulsifying wax, so when it came time to clean them, I simply used soap and hot water. For added assurance, I ran those items through the dishwasher. For items that are harder to wash, like blenders, I generally use a blender that is devoted for non-food use. Again, if you can put the glass part of the blender into the dishwasher, you should be safe. Once the emulsifying wax is mixed with oils and water, it isn't waxy at all and didn't leave a film or waxy substance when I used it. I was left with a lotion/cream, so clean up was a breeze.	[]
