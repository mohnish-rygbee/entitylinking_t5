187	Does this product need to be kept in the refrigerator? Thanks.	Size: 100 ml Our aloe vera gel is made from organically grown pure, green natural leaves without adding absolutely no chemicals or additives. It is viscous and colorless, and is soluble in water and other organic solvents. The raw gel is cleansed with rose water to remove raw smell which is necessary. Therefore the gel might have a gentle fragrance of rose but it does not change the 100% natural properties of the gel in any way. There are absolutely no chemicals or additives. <b>For everyday use:</b> Simply apply the gel anywhere on the body including face, neck and hands. Let the gel dry. First it turns into a thin flaky white layer. This is normal. Give it some time and it will slowly become a moisturous, transparent and invisible film that supplies nutrients to skin. This film helps protect skin from exposing to harmful dust, sun rays, smoke, exhaust fumes etc. If the initial flakiness bothers you during day time, you can also use it at night time and wash it off in the morning. <br /> For more info on this product please visit our official website www.rootsherbal.com	ask_question
